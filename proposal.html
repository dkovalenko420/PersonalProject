    <h1>WebTech Project Proposal</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I would like to create a website for my musical project “dracodraco”. Its objective would be to funnel the
        visitors to the various social media, streaming and merchandise links that are related to the project. The
        target
        audience would be the existing fans of my project. If I look at my Spotify statistics, the fans comprise of
        mostly men (76%) between the ages of 18-27 (69%). I would like it to be a visually unique website with a main
        front page that looks similar to <a href="https://sheltervr.club">this.</a> The front page would then lead the
        visitors into the
        various sub-pages, such as shows, merchandise, streaming, and social media. The whole project would involve
        around 5-6
        pages, not including the homepage, site map and contact pages. The whole appeal of the website revolves around
        the unorthodox, yet intuitive look of the website. As I have been doing graphics design for more than 8 years, I
        am very confident in my abilities to reproduce something of similar look and quality.</p>
